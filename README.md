##  New Features
-  **Improved LSTM model** with **95% confidence interval** on predictions
-  **5%  lower prediction error** over 180+ days of data
-  Enhanced analysis for **long-term trends** using multi-day moving averages
-  User-selectable stock ticker and date range for analysis (via Streamlit UI)
